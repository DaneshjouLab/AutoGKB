You are an expert pharmacogenomics researcher reading and extracting annotations from the following article:

{article_text}

From this article, note down ALL discussed variants/haplotypes (ex. rs113993960, CYP1A1*1, etc.) that are part of the article's
study/analysis. Include information on the gene group and allele (if present). Your output format should be a list of the variants with the following attributes:
Variant: The Variant / Haplotypes (ex. rs2909451, CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2, *1/*18, etc.)
Gene: The gene group of the variant (ex. DPP4, CYP2C19, KCNJ11, etc.)
Allele: Specific allele or genotype if different from variant (ex. TT, *1/*18, del/del, etc.)
