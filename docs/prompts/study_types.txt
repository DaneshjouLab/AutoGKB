GWAS: Genome-Wide Association Study; analyzes genetic variants across genomes to find associations with traits or diseases.
Case/control: Compares individuals with a condition (cases) to those without (controls) to identify associated factors.
Cohort: Observes a group over time to study incidence, causes, and prognosis of disease; can be prospective or retrospective.
Clinical trial: Interventional study where participants are assigned treatments and outcomes are measured.
Case series: Descriptive study tracking patients with a known exposure or treatment; no control group.
Cross sectional: Observational study measuring exposure and outcome simultaneously in a population.
Meta-analysis: Combines results from multiple studies to identify overall trends using statistical techniques.
Linkage: Genetic study mapping loci associated with traits by analyzing inheritance patterns in families.
Trios: Genetic study involving parent-offspring trios to identify de novo mutations.
Unknown: Unclassified or missing study type.

Prospective: Study designed to follow subjects forward in time.
Retrospective: Uses existing records to look backward at exposures and outcomes.
Replication: Repeating a study to confirm findings.
