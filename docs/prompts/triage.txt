You are determining what type of annotations are appropritate for the article from the options of  to extract from a biomedical article. For the article determine the following:

Article: \n\n{article_text}\n\n

Articles get Variant Drug Annotations when they report associations between genetic variants and
pharmacological parameters or clinical drug response measures that specifically relate to:
- Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Parameters
- Clinical phenotypes/adverse events (Drug toxicity, organ dysfunction, treatment response phenotypes, disease outcomes when treated with drugs)

Articles get Variant Phenotype Annotations when they report associations between genetic variants and adverse drug reactions, toxicities, or clinical outcomes that represent:
- Toxicity/Safety outcomes
- Clinical phenotypes/adverse events

Articles get Variant Functional Annotations when they contain in vitro or mechanistic functional studies that directly measure how genetic variants affect:

- Enzyme/transporter activity (e.g., clearance, metabolism, transport)
- Binding affinity (e.g., protein-drug interactions)
- Functional properties (e.g., uptake rates, kinetic parameters like Km/Vmax)

The key distinction is mechanistic functional studies (gets var_fa_ann) vs clinical association studies (gets var_drug_ann or var_pheno_ann but not var_fa_ann).

Examples:

- "Cardiotoxicity when treated with anthracyclines" → var_pheno_ann
- "Decreased clearance of methotrexate" → var_drug_ann
- "Decreased enzyme activity in cell culture" → var_fa_ann
- "Variant affects drug clearance/response" —> var_drug_ann
- "Variant affects adverse events/toxicity outcomes" —> var_pheno_ann
- "Variant affects protein function in laboratory studies" —> var_fa_ann

Using this information, decide which out of the 3 annotations the article should receive with a one sentence summary reason along with a sentence/quote from the article that indicates why this is true.

Output Format:
Variant Drug Annotation: (Y/N)
