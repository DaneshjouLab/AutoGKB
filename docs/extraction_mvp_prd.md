# Pharmacogenomic Information Extraction Ideas

Based on analysis of the benchmark dataset and sample articles, this document outlines approaches for extracting key pharmacogenomic information using language models.

## Dataset Structure Analysis

The benchmark data contains the following key fields that need to be extracted:
- **pmcid**: Article identifier
- **gene**: Gene name (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6, TPMT)
- **drugs**: Drug name(s) 
- **variant_haplotypes**: Specific genetic variants (e.g., rs1799853, CYP2C9*3)
- **alleles**: Genotype/allele information (e.g., CT, *1/*3, AA)
- **metabolizer_types**: Phenotype classification (e.g., poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer)
- **significance**: Whether association is significant (yes/no/not stated)
- **phenotype_category**: Type of effect (Dosage, Metabolism/PK, Efficacy, Other)
- **direction_of_effect**: Effect direction (increased/decreased/null)
- **pd_pk_terms**: Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic measures (e.g., "dose of", "clearance of")
- **population_types**: Study population (e.g., "in people with", "in children with")
- **population_phenotypes_or_diseases**: Disease context (e.g., "Hypertension", "HIV Infections")
- **comparison_alleles_or_genotypes**: Reference genotype for comparison
- **sentence**: Natural language summary of the finding

## Extraction Approaches by Field

### 1. Gene Identification
**Approach**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for pharmacogenes
**Example Prompt**:
```
Extract all gene names mentioned in this pharmacogenomic research article. Focus on genes known to affect drug metabolism, efficacy, or safety. Common pharmacogenes include CYP2D6, CYP2C9, TPMT, DPYD, etc.

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Return only the gene symbols (e.g., CYP2D6, not "cytochrome P450 2D6").
```

### 2. Drug/Medication Extraction
**Approach**: Drug name recognition with normalization
**Example Prompt**:
```
Identify all drugs and medications mentioned in this pharmacogenomic study. Include both generic and brand names, and normalize to standard drug names when possible.

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Return a list of drugs, focusing on those that are the subject of pharmacogenomic analysis.
```

### 3. Genetic Variant Detection
**Approach**: Pattern matching for SNP IDs and star alleles
**Example Prompt**:
```
Extract genetic variants from this text. Look for:
- rs numbers (e.g., rs1799853)
- Star allele nomenclature (e.g., CYP2D6*4, *1/*3)
- Specific genotypes (e.g., CT, AA, GG)

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Format: Return variants in the exact format they appear in the text.
```

### 4. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Effect Extraction
**Approach**: Relation extraction for drug-gene-effect triples
**Example Prompt**:
```
Extract pharmacogenomic associations from this text. For each association, identify:
1. The genetic variant/allele
2. The drug
3. The pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effect (e.g., "increased clearance", "decreased dose", "poor response")
4. The direction of effect (increased/decreased)

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Format each finding as: [Variant] -> [Effect] -> [Drug]
```

### 5. Population and Disease Context
**Approach**: Clinical context extraction
**Example Prompt**:
```
Identify the study population and disease context for this pharmacogenomic research:

1. Population characteristics (e.g., "children", "elderly", "women")
2. Disease conditions (e.g., "hypertension", "schizophrenia", "cancer")
3. Special populations (e.g., "kidney transplant recipients")

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Return the population and diseases as they relate to the pharmacogenomic findings.
```

### 6. Significance Assessment
**Approach**: Statistical significance detection
**Example Prompt**:
```
Determine if the pharmacogenomic associations described in this text are statistically significant. Look for:
- P-values and significance statements
- Confidence intervals
- Explicit statements about significance or non-significance
- Effect sizes

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

For each association, classify as: "yes" (significant), "no" (not significant), or "not stated"
```

### 7. Metabolizer Phenotype Classification
**Approach**: Phenotype terminology extraction
**Example Prompt**:
```
Extract metabolizer phenotype classifications from this pharmacogenomic text:
- Poor metabolizer (PM)
- Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
- Normal/Extensive metabolizer (NM/EM)
- Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Return the specific metabolizer types mentioned and which genetic variants they correspond to.
```

## Comprehensive Extraction Pipeline

### Multi-step Approach
**Step 1: Entity Extraction**
```
From this pharmacogenomic research article, extract all mentions of:
1. Genes (focus on pharmacogenes like CYP, UGT, TPMT families)
2. Drugs and medications
3. Genetic variants (rs numbers, star alleles, genotypes)
4. Disease conditions
5. Study populations

Text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]
```

**Step 2: Relationship Extraction**
```
Given the entities extracted from this pharmacogenomic article, identify relationships between:
- Genetic variants and drug responses
- Genotypes and phenotypes (metabolizer status)
- Drug effects and patient populations
- Statistical associations and their significance

Focus on extracting complete pharmacogenomic associations in the format:
[Genetic variant] in [population] shows [effect direction] [pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic measure] of [drug] compared to [reference genotype]

**Step 3: Structured Output Generation**
```
Convert the extracted pharmacogenomic associations into structured format matching this schema:

{
  "gene": "gene symbol",
  "variant_haplotypes": "specific variant notation", 
  "alleles": "genotype",
  "drugs": "drug name(s)",
  "phenotype_category": "Dosage|Metabolism/PK|Efficacy|Other",
  "significance": "yes|no|not stated",
  "direction_of_effect": "increased|decreased|null",
  "pd_pk_terms": "pharmacological measure",
  "population_types": "population descriptor",
  "population_phenotypes_or_diseases": "disease context",
  "comparison_alleles_or_genotypes": "reference genotype",
  "sentence": "natural language summary"
}

Associations found: [ASSOCIATIONS]

## Quality Control Prompts

### Validation Prompt
```
Review this extracted pharmacogenomic association for accuracy and completeness:

Extracted data: [EXTRACTED_DATA]
Original text: [ARTICLE_TEXT]

Check for:
1. Correct gene-drug-variant mapping
2. Accurate effect direction
3. Proper statistical significance assessment
4. Complete population/disease context
5. Consistent terminology usage

Flag any errors or missing information.
