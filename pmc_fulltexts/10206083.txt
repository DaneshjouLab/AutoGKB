Abstract


Background


Micropapillary (MIP) component was a major concern in determining surgical strategy in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We sought to develop a novel method for detecting MIP component during surgery.
Methods


Differentially expressed proteins between MIP-positive and MIP-negative LUAD were identified through proteomics analysis. The semi-dry dot-blot (SDB) method which visualises the targeted protein was developed to detect MIP component.
Results


Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2) was significantly upregulated in MIP-positive LUAD (
P
 < 0.001), and the high CRABP2 expression zone showed spatial consistency with MIP component. CRABP2 expression was also associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (
P
 < 0.001). In the prospective cohort, the accuracy and sensitivity of detecting MIP component using SDB method by visualising CRABP2 were 82.2% and 72.7%, which were comparable to these of pathologist. Pathologist with the aid of SDB method would improve greatly in diagnostic accuracy (86.4%) and sensitivity (78.2%). In patients with minor MIP component (≤5%), the sensitivity of SDB method (63.6%) was significantly higher than pathologist (45.4%).
Conclusions


Intraoperative examination of CRABP2 using SDB method to detect MIP component reached comparable performance to pathologist, and SDB method had notable superiority than pathologist in detecting minor MIP component.
Subject terms:
 Non-small-cell lung cancer, Proteomic analysis
Background


Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a heterogenous group in pathologic features, and exhibits broad spectrum of prognosis even in early-stage [
1
–
3
]. In 2011, LUAD was classified into five subtypes: lepidic, acinar, papillary, solid and micropapillary (MIP) based on the morphologic pattern by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) [
4
]. This classification system recommends comprehensive histologic subtyping based on pattern recognition and a semiquantitative assessment of each pattern in 5% increments in invasive LUAD. Numerous researches have confirmed the impact of classification system on surgical decision-making, survival stratification and administration of adjuvant therapy [
5
–
7
].


Of that, MIP predominant LUAD was strongly associated with aggressive clinicopathologic behaviours, including nodal involvement, presence of tumour spread through air space (STAS), lymph node micrometastasis, and ultimately resulted in a higher postoperative recurrence rate compared to other histologic subtypes [
8
–
12
]. Importantly, even a minor percentage of MIP component would have significant impact on surgical strategy and the extent of lymph node dissection [
13
–
15
]. Previous studies found that patients with MIP component who underwent segmentectomy had significantly unfavourable survival than those who underwent lobectomy [
13
, 
14
]. Therefore, detecting MIP component accurately before or during surgery is crucial to determine optimal surgical strategy for early-stage LUAD.


Use of preoperative CT to predict MIP has been reported in several studies, but the predictive accuracy and sensitivity were not satisfactory [
16
]. The preoperative biopsy specimens used for estimation of histologic subtypes were also demonstrated to be inaccurate, since the limited specimen could not represent the panoramic view of the tumour [
17
]. Moreover, using the intraoperative frozen section (FS) to identify MIP component was still challengeable with the sensitivity less than 40% [
18
, 
19
].


In this study, we performed proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between MIP-positive and MIP-negative LUAD samples. Moreover, we developed a novel method for detecting MIP component during the surgery by visualisation of DEPs using semi-dry dot-blot (SDB) method, and compared its diagnostic performance with a pathologist panel.
Patients and methods


Study patients


The institutional review board of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital affiliated to Tongji University approved this study (IRB NO: L21-340), the informed consent from individual patients was waived. Fresh frozen tumour tissues weighting around 300 mg from three MIP predominant and three MIP-negative LUAD patients were prospectively collected and used for proteomics analysis to identify DEPs. To validate the correlation between DEPs and MIP component, a retrospective cohort of 147 clinical stage I–IIA LUAD patients who underwent radical resection between April 2013 and September 2013 were enroled for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Patients who had preoperative treatment or history of malignant tumour were excluded from this retrospective cohort.


To assess the diagnostic performance of employing the SDB method to identify MIP component, a prospective cohort of 118 clinical stage I–IIA LUAD that underwent surgical resection from October 2021 to December 2021 were collected. Meanwhile, an experienced pathologist (SZ) examined the FS slides to evaluate the status of MIP component on routine FS diagnosis. After that, Dr. Zhao reevaluated the status of MIP component combined with SDB auxiliary. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and time spent were compared among SDB method, pathologist, and pathologist with aid of SDB method. The total time spent was calculated from the moment the specimen was removed to the moment the diagnosis was made.
Proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins


Three MIP-positive and three MIP-negative frozen tumour tissues were employed for proteomics analysis. Liquid chromatography–tandem MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) that was coupled to Easy nLC (Proxeon Biosystems) for 120 min with the help provided by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The raw data for each sample were combined and searched using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.17) for identification and quantitation analysis. Quantifiable proteins were defined as those can be identified at least twice in the three biological replicates. Proteins with 
P
-value < 0.05 and abundance fold change (FC) > 2 were defined as differentially expressed between the MIP-positive and MIP-negative groups.
Evaluation of histologic patterns and IHC staining


Two experienced pathologists (HX and XX) independently reviewed all the hematoxylin and eosin
-
stained tumour slides from retrospective and prospective cohorts. When a disagreement occurred, another senior pathologist (CW) would review the slide in doubt to achieve a consensus. All the five traditional histologic patterns were recognised according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification with a 5% increment [
4
], and complex glands (including cribriform and fused glands) were reviewed and included to a sum of 100% according to the IASLC newly proposed grading system [
20
]. Visceral plural invasion, STAS, and lymphovascular invasion were also assessed in the permanent slides. The FS slides in the prospective cohort were recorded in similar manner with those of permanent slides. In this study, MIP positive was defined as tumours with MIP component greater or equal to 5%. Otherwise, tumour without MIP component was defined as MIP negative. Tumours with MIP negative or 5% MIP was defined as minor MIP group (MIP ≤ 5%).


Four significantly upregulated proteins (cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2, CRABP2; cartilage intermediate layer protein 1, CILP; pyruvate carboxylase, PCB; beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5, B4GALT5) with FC larger than 10 in MIP-positive group were selected as targeted proteins via proteomics analysis. IHC staining for these four selected targeted proteins was performed following the protocol of previous studies [
21
]. For each patient in the retrospective cohort, four serial 4 μm thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides were prepared for CRABP2 (abcam, ab181255), CILP (abcam, ab192881), PCB (abcam, ab115579) and B4GALT5 (abcam, ab110398) staining. All the slides were examined by a senior pathologist (CW).


Histochemistry score (H-score) was used to measure the staining intensity of the targeted proteins in IHC staining semi-quantitatively. Cases were scored as negative, weakly positive, moderately positive or strongly positive according to the percentage of positive cells, after which an H-score was generated (this being a score of 0–3 intensity multiplied by the percentage of positive cells [range 0–300]). The prognostic impact of targeted protein H-score and its relationship with MIP percentage were evaluated. The prognostic impact and clinicopathologic features of targeted protein were then validated using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and a total of 461 LUAD (
GSE29013
, 
GSE31210
, 
GSE31908
, 
GSE50081
 and 
GSE8894
) were extracted. The median value of targeted protein expression in the GEO cohort was used to categorise patients into high and low expression groups. Moreover, 51 LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) programme with annotated predominant histologic subtype were enroled to confirm the differential expression of targeted protein between MIP predominant and non-MIP predominant LUAD.
Development of semi-dry dot-blot method to identify MIP component


After the validation of targeted proteins using IHC staining and publicly available datasets, CRABP2 was selected as the most valuable targeted protein to develop SDB system for detecting MIP component intraoperatively. Specimens were sliced into two blocks (block A and block B) along the largest diameter interface of the tumour. Two or three layers of tissue section at the largest diameter interface of block A were taken for the routine FS diagnosis by pathologist.


Figure 
1
 showed the schematic diagram of the SDB method. A small block with dimensions of 5 × 5 × 3 mm derived from the centre of block B was sliced into several parallel sections at the maximum diameter. The dissected tumour tissues were washed for 30 s with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, then suspended cells in the lavage fluid were centrifuged to collect cell pellet. The RIPA lysis buffer was used to lyse the cell pellet to extract proteins. The dot-blot membrane (modified nylon membrane) was soaked in wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). The monoclonal antibody to CRABP2 was used as the primary antibody, and peroxidase-coupled immunoglobulin G (ImmPRESS anti-mouse/ rabbit immunoglobulin G; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) was used as the secondary antibody. Two circles with one centimeter in diameter were drawn on the membrane. Both primary and secondary antibodies were placed onto the first circle for the actual test, and primary antibody alone was placed onto the other circle as a reference. The membrane was incubated with the two antibodies for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was visualised by chromogenic using a Vector VIP substrate kit (Vector Laboratories), which reveals the presence of peroxidase activity through releasing a purple chromogen. The SDB method was determined as positive result when a denser appearance of chromogen in the circle of the actual test than that in the reference one. In contrast, equal density of chromogen in both circles manifested negative result. The time spent of SDB method was recorded.

The fresh tumour tissue was sliced and washed by phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were lysed to extract proteins. The samples were added into the test and reference circle on the membrane that was incubated with anti-CRABP2. The result was confirmed by colorimetric detection. SDB semi-dry dot-blot, CRABP2 cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2.
Statistical analysis


The association between MIP percentage and CRABP2 H-score was assessed by linear regression analysis. The optimal cutoff value for stratifying CRABP2 H-score into high and low expression groups were determined by X-tile software (version 3.6.1) based on the maximum χ
2
 score and minimum 
P-
value. The Image J software was applied to quantify the integrated density of the SDB staining in the test circle and reference circle, the integrated density ratio of test to reference was then used to investigate the relationship between the SDB staining intensity and MIP percentage. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were performed for survival analysis. The area under receiver operating curves (AUC) were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy among SDB method, pathologist, and pathologist with aid of SDB. A decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to quantify the benefit of accuracy in detecting MIP component. A larger area under the decision curve indicated that the diagnostic method was more accurate for detecting MIP component. A two-sided 
P-
value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the statistical analysis were performed via SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R software (version 3.6.1, 
http://www.R-project.org
).

Proteomic landscape of LUAD with or without MIP component


In order to identify the DEPs between MIP-positive and -negative LUAD, label-free proteomics analysis was performed on three MIP-positive LUAD and three MIP-negative LUAD (Fig. 
2a, b
). Patients in the MIP-positive group had 40%, 60%, and 60% MIP component, respectively. The baseline characteristics of the six patients were shown in Table. 
S1
. A total of 5166 proteins were identified with high confidence, and 4612 proteins were reliably quantified in no less than 50% samples in at least one group between MIP-positive and MIP-negative groups (Fig. 
S1A
). Venn diagram (Fig. 
S1B, C
) was used to analyse the reproducibility of identified proteins within groups, 3871 (78.0%) and 3259 (73.4%) proteins were found to be shared within the MIP-positive and MIP-negative groups, respectively. Additionally, 4311 (84.6%) proteins were shared between MIP-positive and -negative groups, whereas 654 (12.8%) and 129 (2.5%) proteins were specific to MIP-positive and MIP-negative tumours, respectively (Fig. 
S1D
). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the upregulation in MIP-positive tissues including peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors signalling pathway, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, which are associated with cancer invasion and metastasis (Fig. 
S1E
).

Furthermore, we screened for DEPs (FC > 2 and 
P
 < 0.05) between MIP positive and MIP negative via group 
t
-test, and 276 DEPs including 170 upregulated and 106 downregulated DEPs were identified (Fig. 
2c
). Details of DEPs were listed in Table. 
S2
. Additionally, four DEPs were significantly upregulated in MIP-positive group with FC > 10. Volcano plots indicating the FC in expression and the statistical significance of MIP-positive versus MIP-negative tumours were shown in Fig. 
2d
. The most highly upregulated proteins in MIP-positive group, CRABP2, CILP, PCB and B4GALT, were preliminarily selected as the targeted proteins for visualisation of MIP component by SDB method, despite the adjusted 
P
-values for the abovementioned proteins did not reach significance in the volcano plots after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (Fig. 
S2
) due to the relatively small sample size.
Validation of targeted protein for identifying MIP component using SDB method


IHC staining of the four targeted proteins was performed in the retrospective cohort of 147 LUAD to validate the specificity (Fig. 
2e
). IHC staining demonstrated that the high expression of CRABP2 was primarily localised in MIP component, linear regression analysis also revealed that CRABP2 H-score was strongly correlated with the MIP percentage (R
2
 = 0.5081, Fig. 
2f
). In an independent cohort of 51 LUAD from TCGA dataset with annotated predominant histologic subtype, MIP predominant LUAD had higher levels of CRABP2 expression than acinar/papillary/solid predominant LUAD (Fig. 
S3
, 
P
 = 0.007). However, CILP and PCB showed light staining in tumour tissues, the B4GALT5 expression was higher in tumour tissue but specific to acinar component (Fig. 
2e
). The linear analysis also demonstrated that the H-score of these three proteins were slightly associated with the MIP percentage (Fig. 
S4
).


To further evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of CRABP2 expression in the 147 LUAD, the CRABP2 expression H-score was classified into high (H-score > 100) and low (H-score ≤ 100) expression groups via X-tile software (Fig. 
S5
). The clinicopathological characteristics according to CRABP2 expression level were compared in Table. 
S3
. Patients in the group with high CRABP2 expression had larger tumour size (
P
 = 0.004), advanced T stage (
P
 = 0.043), higher frequency of STAS (
P
 = 0.020), more MIP predominant LUAD (
P
 = 0.020), more MIP-positive LUAD (
P
 < 0.001) and higher recurrence rate (
P
 = 0.029). The survival analysis found that higher CRABP2 expression was relevant with decreased recurrence-free survival (
P
 = 0.017, Fig. 
2g
). Similarly, patients with higher CRABP2 expression were associated with advanced pathologic stage (Table. 
S4
, 
P
 = 0.063) and a deterioration in recurrence-free survival referring to an independent 461 LUAD composed cohort from GEO database (
P
 = 0.01, Fig. 
2h
). These results suggested that CRABP2 was highly relevant to MIP component and was finally selected as the targeted protein of MIP component in SDB method.


We developed SDB method for detecting MIP component intraoperatively via visualisation of CRABP2, the positive result was defined as a denser appearance of chromogen in the actual test than that in the reference. As shown in Fig. 
3
, patient one with a part-solid nodule underwent limited resection, the SDB method found CRABP2 was negative in colorimetric detection, and the final pathology confirmed the absence of MIP component. Patient two and three with 10 and 60% MIP component were successfully detected by SDB method and been confirmed in the final pathology. More examples of SDB appearance and corresponding final pathology were displayed in Fig. 
S6
.

 Patients 2 and 3 had 10 and 60% MIP component, intraoperative SDB method found denser appearance of chromogen in the test circle. SDB semi-dry dot-blot, MIP micropapillary.
Furthermore, we explored the spatial specificity of CRABP2 expression using the SDB method by sampling two blocks within a single tumour in three patients (Fig. 
S7
). Patient one had been determined by the pathologist to be MIP negative in both FS-B-1 and FS-B-2, and the SDB results supported this finding. According to the pathologist’s FS diagnosis, patients two and three had MIP component in FS-B-1 but not in FS-B-2, while the SDB method showed positive results for MIP component in both block B-1 and block B-2. These findings showed that the histologic composition of the LUAD was spatially heterogeneous, making it difficult for the normal FS examination to fully assess MIP in every level of the sample tumour tissue. It was more beneficial to use the SDB method to thoroughly assess the CRABP2 expression of the entire sampling block to detect MIP component.
Comparison of diagnostic performance between SDB method and pathologist in a prospective cohort


To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the SDB method for intraoperative MIP component detection, a prospective cohort of 118 clinical stage I–IIA LUAD was used. Table 
1
 listed the clinicopathologic characteristics for MIP-positive (
n
 = 55) and MIP-negative (
n
 = 63) individuals. Patients in the MIP-positive group had more lobectomies (
P
 = 0.016), larger tumour size (
P
 < 0.001), advanced T stage (
P
 = 0.001), higher frequency of visceral pleural invasion (
P
 < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (
P
 < 0.001) and STAS (
P
 < 0.001). We then explored the correlation between SDB staining intensity and MIP percentage in this prospective cohort, increased integrated density ratio of test to reference circle on SDB staining was found to be positively correlated with the increase of MIP percentage (Fig. 
S8
, R
2
 = 0.3089, 
P
 < 0.001).

For all patients, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of SDB method for detecting MIP component were 82.2%, 72.7%, and 90.5%, respectively (Table 
2
). The SDB method was able to successfully identify 40 of the 55 MIP-positive patients. In these 15 missed cases by SDB method, pathologist missed four cases in addition to the 11 that were correctly identified. On the other hand, 10 of the 14 cases missed by the pathologist were correctly recognised, while four cases were also missed by SDB method. The corresponding FS slide of the missed cases in SDB method was reevaluated by the pathologists, we found that nine missed cases were due to the sampling error, and six missed cases were due to suboptimal performance of the SDB method.

Comparison of diagnostic performance in patients with minor MIP component


Minor MIP component was also reported to be significantly correlated with unfavourable prognosis and play an important role in surgical decision-making [
14
, 
22
]. In order to evaluate the performance of SDB method in detecting minor percentage of MIP component (≤5%, defined as negative MIP or 5% MIP), which was challenging for junior pathologists to realise through FS slides, subgroup analysis in patients with MIP ≤ 5% were conducted. There were 22 patients with 5% MIP and 63 patients without MIP component. Table 
2
 showed the diagnostic performance, and Table. 
S5
 presented a comparison of the three diagnostic models. SDB method outperformed pathologist in terms of diagnostic accuracy (83.5% vs. 76.5%) and sensitivity (63.6% vs. 45.4%). In terms of pathologist with aid of SDB method, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity elevated to 88.2%, 72.7% and 93.6%, respectively. The average time spent in subgroup analysis indicated similar tendency with the result in all patients, the average time spent was 27.9, 31.5 and 33.5 min for SDB, pathologist and pathologist with aid of SDB method, respectively.


Furthermore, the AUC and DCA analysis were performed to evaluate the performance in detecting minor MIP component quantitatively (Fig. 
4c, d
). The AUC values were 0.771, 0.664 and 0.832 for SDB method, pathologist and pathologist with aid of SDB. The DCA indicated that pathologist with aid of SDB provided the largest net benefit, and SDB method provided greater net benefit in predicting minor MIP component than pathologist. These results demonstrated that the SDB method outperformed pathologist in detecting minor MIP component, suggesting that it might be useful in identifying cases that would be easily missed by pathologists.
Discussion


Given to the prognostic impact of MIP component and its role in determining surgical strategy in early-stage LUAD, preoperative or intraoperative grasping the presence of MIP component could be vital for matching patients into an approximate surgical type. In this study, we identified 276 DEPs between MIP-positive and MIP-negative groups using proteomics analysis, and developed a novel method to identify MIP component via CRABP2 visualisation. We prospectively demonstrated that SDB method was feasible for intraoperative detection of MIP component with a sensitivity of 72.7%, that was comparable to pathologist. Moreover, the advantage of SDB method was reflected in detecting minor MIP component, which was superior to pathologist (sensitivity, 63.6% vs. 45.4%). For pathologist with aid of SDB method, the diagnostic performance was further improved.


Lobectomy was deemed as the standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer [
23
], but the controversy between lobectomy and limited resection has continued to heat up since a large amount of small-sized lung nodules were detected by low-dose computed tomography [
24
, 
25
]. The practical implications of limited resection have greatly extended over the past several years [
26
–
29
]. Recently, the JCOG0802/WJOG4607L study firstly demonstrated the superiority of segmentectomy over lobectomy in overall survival (94.3% vs. 91.1%, 
P
 = 0.0082) for small-sized (≤2 cm) peripheral non-small cell lung cancer [
30
]. Of note, patients in segmentectomy group experienced more locoregional recurrences than patients in lobectomy group (10.5% vs. 5.4%, 
P
 = 0.0018). Hence, clinical implications of segmentectomy needs to be further discussed by accumulating more evidence from other similar studies such as CALGB/Alliance 140503 [
31
] and our ongoing randomised trials (
NCT 04937283
).


The IASLC/ATS/ERS proposed histologic classification was a strong classifier of prognosis, patients with MIP predominant LUAD probably correlated with aggressive behaviour. Furthermore, Raul et al. [
32
] found that MIP predominant LUAD had a higher tumour mutation burden, increased chromosomal instability, and more oncogenic pathway alterations compared with other histologic subtypes, that unravel the aggressive behaviour of MIP predominant LUAD from a biological point of view. In addition to predominant subtype, Zhao et al. [
22
]. reported that even minor MIP component were associated with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis. Importantly, we and other researchers confirmed the presence of MIP component was associated with increased risk of postoperative recurrence in patients treated with limited resection than lobectomy [
13
, 
14
]. These results indicated that limited resection was insufficient for LUAD harbouring MIP component, and detection of MIP component could help surgeons prevent local control failure after limited resection.


Through efforts have been tried to identify MIP component using preoperative CT, needle biopsy or intraoperative FS. Huang et al. [
17
]. reported that the overall concordance of predominant histologic subtype was 58.6% between preoperative CT guided needle biopsy and final pathology, but none of the five MIP predominant cases were detected. The limited volume of retrieved specimen, that cannot represent the panoramic view of tumour, restricted the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative needle biopsy. CT-based radiomics were recently explored to predict MIP component, Song et al. [
33
]. reported that combining imaging parameters with clinical features can provide favourable diagnostic accuracy, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying presence of MIP component were 54.9% and 64.0%, respectively. Nevertheless, the radiomics approach had a strict requirement in CT scan parameters’ acquisition and the performance of existed model for predicting MIP component was moderate and might not be suitable for clinical practice yet. Intraoperative FS examination with a large amount of tissue available for evaluation is a practical option, providing more information than preoperative methods in consideration of the histologically heterogeneity of the tumour. Yeh et al. [
18
]. firstly reported the accuracy of using FS to identify histologic subtypes, they found the sensitivity in predicting presence of MIP component was only 37%. Therefore, a novel method that can identify MIP component in real time with higher accuracy needs to be developed.


We hypothesised that MIP-positive LUAD display distinct patterns of differential protein abundance in comparison with MIP-negative LUAD, and these proteins that are characteristically abundant in MIP-positive LUAD may imply new candidate biomarkers for MIP component detection. We performed proteomics analysis to characterise DEPs between MIP-positive and MIP-negative LUAD tissues, and validated the targeted protein of CRABP2 via IHC staining. CRABP2 belongs to fatty acid-binding protein family which binds with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). In cells that express high levels of CRABP2, RA is a pro-apoptotic agent and promotes the survival of cells [
34
]. CRABP2 is reported to be highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck tumours, and also in lung cancer, which is closely associated with high tumour invasion and poor prognosis [
21
, 
35
–
37
]. In the present study, CRABP2 was expressed highly in MIP-positive LUAD group and was highly relevant to MIP component in IHC staining. Based on these results, CRABP2 may play a role in cancer development which could be used to explain the aggressive behaviour of MIP-positive LUAD preliminarily.


Hirakawa et al. [
38
]. firstly introduced the SDB method to visualise lymph node metastasis by detecting anti-pancytokeratin intraoperatively. The SDB method possessed a short reaction time to make a solid phase that allow it to be implemented into intraoperative practice. The most predominant advantage of SDB method was its simple procedure without requirement of special equipment and rich experience in FS diagnosis. Previous studies mainly apply the SDB method into identification of lymph node metastasis [
39
–
42
]. In this study, we developed the SDB method to predict MIP component by visualising CRABP2. The sensitivity and specificity of SDB method was comparable to senior pathologist, and pathologist with aid of SDB method had a greater diagnostic sensitivity of 78.2%. Of note, the time spent in SDB method was shorter than regular FS examination. Additionally, minor percentage of MIP which was easily missed in FS could be detected more accurately by SDB method (sensitivity, SDB method vs. pathologists: 63.6% vs. 45.4%). Moreover, the consumption of tumour tissues for SDB methods was derived from an isolated half block, so that SDB would not interfere with routine FS diagnosis.


Currently, use of protein biomarkers, such as cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin-19 fragment and the precursor form of surfactant protein B were mainly applied in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules [
43
–
46
]. Using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, Kim et al. [
47
]. examined the levels of CRABP2 in plasma and came to the conclusion that these levels may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, it is possible to assess the levels of CRABP2 expression in blood. There hasn’t been any research on employing blood biomarkers to detect histologic components, thus it is unknown whether protein biomarkers specific to MIP components were released into the blood. Furthermore, as a singular protein showed subpar performance in screening and diagnosis [
46
], the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting MIP component using CRABP2 alone in blood were important issues for implementing it into clinical practice. Future study in this area would be fascinating to pursue.


Although the SDB method was an accurate, simple, and time-saving approach for detecting MIP component, there were several limitations in this study. Firstly, the sample size for proteomics analysis to discriminate DEPs was small, and the tumour tissue was not purified by microdissection since the histologic heterogeneity was intrinsic to LUAD. A larger sample size using purified tumour tissue could provide more solid evidence. Secondly, the enroled patients in the prospective cohort, consisting of clinical stage I to IIA LUAD, exceeded the general indication for limited resection that required no more than 2 cm in tumours’ diameter. However, the prospective cohort was designed to continuously enrol patients to avoid selection bias. Thirdly, it is more rigorous to sample a section for FS diagnosis from block B after SDB process to comprehensively evaluate the MIP component. However, it was restricted to insufficient tissue left for FS diagnosis after SDB process especially for small-sized tumour, more sensitive method that sacrificing less tumour tissue to identify MIP component was worth to expect in the future. Finally, prospective randomised trials comparing limited resection and lobectomy based on the presence of MIP component using SDB method was warranted to consolidate our results.
Conclusion


In conclusion, we developed a brand-new, reliable, and economic SDB method to detect MIP component based on the proteomics analysis, which could become an alternative for detecting MIP. The SDB method manifested comparable performance in detecting MIP compared with pathologist, and higher accuracy and sensitivity in recognising cases with minor MIP component. The SDB method could become complementary to pathologists in identifying MIP component during surgery.
