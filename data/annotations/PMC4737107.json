            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype on thiopurine dose intensity, myelosuppression, and treatment outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) within the UK ALL97 trial. The trial compared the effects of different TPMT genotypes on treatment outcomes, finding that TPMT heterozygotes, particularly those with the TPMT*1/*3A variant, had better event-free survival (EFS) compared to wild-type patients, despite experiencing more frequent cytopenias and requiring dose adjustments. The study concluded that thiopurine-induced cytopenias did not negatively affect treatment outcomes, and TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had a better EFS than TPMT wild-type patients.",
