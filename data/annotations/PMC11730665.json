    "study_parameters": {
        "summary": "This study compared the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with glucotoxicity. It was a 12-week, single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial. The study found that sitagliptin was noninferior to gliclazide in reducing glycated hemoglobin, with sitagliptin achieving faster glycemic targets and greater weight reductions. Genetic polymorphisms significantly affected drug efficacy, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine.",
