            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the association between specific HLA alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) in the Thai population, given the known genetic predispositions to such reactions with other antiepileptic drugs. Conducted as a case-control study, it involved 15 patients with lamotrigine-induced CADR and 50 lamotrigine-tolerant controls, with HLA genotyping performed to identify potential genetic markers. The results revealed significant associations of HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 with lamotrigine-induced CADR, suggesting these alleles could serve as useful screening markers to prevent adverse reactions in Thai patients.",
