        "summary": "This study investigated the impact of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants on bleeding risk in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with warfarin. It was a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, a randomized, double-blind, multinational clinical trial comparing edoxaban and warfarin. The study found that patients with sensitive or highly sensitive genotypes had increased bleeding risk with warfarin.",

            "explanation": "The study is a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, which is a randomized, double-blind, multinational clinical trial. It replicates findings from a previous study (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) in a different population.",

Among these, 63.0% were normal responders, 34.1% were sensitive responders, and 2.8% were highly sensitive responders. The study population included Caucasians, African Americans, and East Asians, with a higher proportion of sensitive and highly sensitive responders being of Asian ancestry.",
