            "content": "The study aimed to determine if genetic variants could identify patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) at increased risk of bleeding when treated with warfarin. Conducted as a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, it involved genotyping patients for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants to classify them into warfarin sensitivity types. The results showed that sensitive and highly sensitive responders, based on their genotypes, had a higher risk of bleeding, spent more time overanticoagulated, and required lower warfarin doses compared to normal responders, highlighting the potential of genetic testing in managing warfarin therapy.",
