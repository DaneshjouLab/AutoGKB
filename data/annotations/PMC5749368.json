Conducted as a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, the study genotyped patients and categorized them into warfarin sensitivity types. Results showed that sensitive and highly sensitive responders, based on their genotypes, had a higher risk of bleeding, required lower warfarin doses, and spent more time overanticoagulated compared to normal responders.",

The majority of participants were male, with 60.4% in the normal responders group, 58.7% in the sensitive responders group, and 53.4% in the highly sensitive responders group. Ethnically, the majority were Caucasian, comprising 82.6% of normal responders, 82.1% of sensitive responders, and 82.4% of highly sensitive responders. A notable proportion of sensitive and highly sensitive responders were of Asian ancestry, reflecting known genetic differences in warfarin sensitivity.

The trial included 8,292 patients from 439 centers worldwide, but this subanalysis focused on 3,956 patients who were genotyped for variants in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. These patients were divided into three warfarin sensitivity types (normal, sensitive, and highly sensitive) based on their genotypes.

It found that patients with certain *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* genotypes, classified as sensitive or highly sensitive responders, had an increased risk of bleeding compared to normal responders. Specifically, sensitive responders had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.38 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.71, p=0.0035) and highly sensitive responders had an HR of 1.79 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.99, p=0.0252) for bleeding events.
