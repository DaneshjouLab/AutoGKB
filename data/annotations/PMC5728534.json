    "study_parameters": {
        "summary": "This study investigated the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the OCT1 and OCT2 transporters on the uptake of ranitidine, a common H2-receptor antagonist. Using cell lines overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that certain OCT1 polymorphisms significantly reduced or abolished ranitidine uptake, while OCT2 had limited impact. These findings suggest that OCT1 polymorphisms could influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.",
