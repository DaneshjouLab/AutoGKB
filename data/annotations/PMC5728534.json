            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variants. While certain OCT1 alleles completely lacked ranitidine uptake, others showed reduced or increased uptake, and OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake unaffected by its common polymorphism. These findings highlight the potential for genetic variability in OCT1 to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions.",
