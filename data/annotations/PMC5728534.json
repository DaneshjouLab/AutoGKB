            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a common H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 allele, while OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake unaffected by its common polymorphism. The findings suggest that OCT1 polymorphisms could influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and its potential for drug-drug interactions.",

The study also found that ranitidine inhibited OCT1-mediated uptake of metformin and morphine, with the inhibitory potency being genotype-dependent, particularly for the OCT1*2 allele. In contrast, OCT2 showed limited uptake of ranitidine, which was not significantly affected by the Ala270Ser polymorphism. The findings suggest that genetic variations in OCT1 can modulate ranitidine's pharmacokinetics and its potential for drug-drug interactions, although the clinical implications of these effects remain to be explored.",
