            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 allelic variants, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variant. In contrast, OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake, unaffected by the Ala270Ser polymorphism, highlighting the potential for OCT1 polymorphisms to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions.",

In contrast, the OCT1*8 allele showed a 25% increase in vmax, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). The study also found that ranitidine inhibited OCT1-mediated uptake of metformin and morphine, with genotype-dependent differences in inhibitory potency, particularly for the OCT1*2 allele. OCT2 showed limited uptake of ranitidine, which was not significantly affected by the Ala270Ser polymorphism. The findings suggest that poor OCT1 transporters may have increased plasma concentrations of ranitidine, but due to its broad therapeutic range, this is unlikely to have clinical consequences.",
